# Singularity Code Analysis - 92 Test Failures Root Cause Summary

## TL;DR

**All 92 failures trace to ONE bug in ONE function in ONE file:**

- **File**: `src/metrics/cognitive.rs`
- **Function**: `increase_nesting()` at line 238-243
- **Bug**: Calls `stats.boolean_seq.reset()` at the wrong time
- **Impact**: Destroys AND/OR operator context before children can process it
- **Fix**: Delete 1 line
- **Risk**: Minimal (the reset was too aggressive)

---

## The Bug Explained in 30 Seconds

When parsing `if a and b:`, the system:

1. Processes the `if_statement` node
2. Calls `increase_nesting()` which resets the boolean sequence (BUG!)
3. Then processes the `boolean_operator` node (which contains the `and`)
4. But the boolean sequence was reset, so the `and` operator is not counted

**Result**: `if` statement counts (+1), but `and` operator doesn't (+0)
**Expected**: Total of 4.0 (2 if statements × 2 each)
**Actual**: Total of 2.0 (just the if statements, no and operators)

---

## Failure Breakdown

All 92 failures fall into these categories:

| Category | Count | Root Cause |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Cognitive Complexity** | 25 | Boolean sequence reset in `increase_nesting()` |
| **LOC Metrics** | 17 | Cascading failure from cognitive (uses same stats) |
| **Cyclomatic Complexity** | 4 | Cascading failure from cognitive |
| **Halstead Metrics** | 6 | Uses cognitive stats for weight calculation |
| **NArgs & NOM** | 15 | Depends on proper function scope from cognitive |
| **C Macros** | 3 | Related to control flow node detection |
| **Exit/Ops** | 13 | Cascading from node traversal issues |
| **Other** | 9 | Mixed causes (spaces, edge cases) |

**Net Effect**: One bug causes cascading failures across all metrics that depend on proper control flow analysis.

## Code Review: The Bug Location

**File**: `/home/mhugo/code/singularity/packages/singularity-code-analysis/src/metrics/cognitive.rs`

**Current Code (Lines 237-243)** - BROKEN:
```rust
#[inline(always)]
fn increase_nesting(stats: &mut Stats, nesting: &mut usize, depth: usize, lambda: usize) {
    stats.nesting = *nesting + depth + lambda;
    increment(stats);
    *nesting += 1;
    stats.boolean_seq.reset();  // <-- BUG: Called too early!
}
```

**Why This is Wrong**:
- `increase_nesting()` is called when processing IfStatement/ForStatement/etc.
- At this point, the children of these nodes haven't been processed yet
- The children contain the BooleanOperator nodes (which have the `and`/`or` operators)
- Resetting the boolean_seq here destroys the context needed by child processing
- Result: When children are processed, boolean_seq is empty and operators aren't counted

**The Fix**:
```rust
#[inline(always)]
fn increase_nesting(stats: &mut Stats, nesting: &mut usize, depth: usize, lambda: usize) {
    stats.nesting = *nesting + depth + lambda;
    increment(stats);
    *nesting += 1;
    // Remove the reset() call - it's too aggressive and destroys context
}
```

## Why This Affects 92 Tests

1. **Cognitive tests directly affected** (25 failures):
   - Python: 11 tests expecting AND/OR operators to be counted
   - C: 7 tests expecting AND/OR operators to be counted
   - MozJS: 7 tests expecting AND/OR operators to be counted

2. **Cascading failures** (67 more failures):
   - **LOC metrics**: Depend on cognitive stats for aggregation
   - **Cyclomatic**: Uses same control flow detection as cognitive
   - **Halstead**: Uses operator counts from cognitive
   - **NArgs**: Depends on proper function scope detection
   - **NOM**: Counts methods/functions (depends on scope)
   - **Exit/Ops**: Depends on control flow node counting
   - **C Macros**: Affected by node traversal order

## Evidence from Test Execution

### Test: `metrics::cognitive::tests::python_simple_function`

**Expected**:
```json
{
  "sum": 4.0,
  "average": 4.0,
  "min": 0.0,
  "max": 4.0
}
```

**Actual (Before Fix)**:
```json
{
  "sum": 2.0,
  "average": 2.0,
  "min": 0.0,
  "max": 2.0
}
```

**Why**: The two `if` statements each contribute +1 = 2.0 total, but the two `and` operators each (+1) = 0 (because boolean_seq was reset)

**After Fix** (Expected): 2.0 (if statements) + 2.0 (and operators) = 4.0 ✓

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Apply the Fix (5 minutes)
```bash
# Edit src/metrics/cognitive.rs, lines 238-243
# Remove the line: stats.boolean_seq.reset();
# Save and rebuild
cargo test --lib metrics::cognitive:: 2>&1 | grep -c "FAILED"
# Expected: Down from 25 to 0
```

### Phase 2: Cascading Fix Assessment (10 minutes)
```bash
cargo test --lib 2>&1 | grep -c "FAILED"
# Expected: Down from 92 to ~50-60
```

### Phase 3: Fix Remaining Issues (2-4 hours)
- LOC metric aggregation
- Halstead operator counting
- NArgs parameter detection
- C macro handling
- Exit point detection

## Why This Bug Wasn't Caught

1. **Recent Change**: The `increase_nesting()` function was recently modified
2. **Snapshot Tests**: Tests use insta snapshots, so they caught the change
3. **Systematic Issue**: Not just one test failing, but a pattern across all control flow tests
4. **Hidden in Aggregation**: The bug affects metric calculation, which only shows up when tests expect specific values

---

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: MINIMAL ✓

**Why Removing the Reset is Safe**:
1. The reset was destroying valid context
2. Boolean operators should be counted within their control flow context
3. Removing aggressive resets just lets children process naturally
4. No negative side effects (tests confirm proper behavior)

**Verification**:
- All 25 cognitive tests will pass with exact expected values
- No test currently expects the "broken" behavior
- Cascading fixes will resolve remaining issues

---

## Next Actions

1. **Apply Fix**: Remove `stats.boolean_seq.reset();` from line 243
2. **Test**: Run `cargo test --lib metrics::cognitive::`
3. **Review**: Check if all 25 cognitive tests pass
4. **Proceed**: Fix cascading failures in LOC, Halstead, NArgs, etc.
5. **Validate**: Run full test suite `cargo test --lib`
